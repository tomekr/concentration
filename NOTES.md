# Developing ios 11 Applications in Swift

## Lecture 1: Introduction to iOS 11, Xcode 9 and Swift 4

Swift is a strongly typed language

Command+Click code in editor to rename something that is also connected to the UI

## Lecture 2: MVC

The Model and View should never speak to each other

View uses delegates as callbacks (should, will, did)

The model can use a radio station to broadcast changes that the controller can pick up via receivers and do some action based on that change
    * In iOS this is called Notification and KVO

In Swift, Structs and Classes are VERY similar

main differences:

1. Structs have no inheritance
2. Structs are value types, Classes are reference types
    * value types are copied (copy on write semantics)
    * reference types are pointers


classes get a free init as long as all of their variables are initialized

struct gets a free initializer too 


Binaries/Frameworks can be added in the build config

## Lecture 3: Swift Programming Language

UI Stack view (just another class like UIButton, UILabel)

* takes other views and stacks them together. Only knows horizontal OR vertical

Going over stacking UI elements and doing a more consistent view

How do you create a CountableRange from floating point numbers?

* there is a global function called `stride`

A typle is nothing more that a grouping of values

* Example: `let x: (String, Int, Double) = ("hello", 5, 0.85)`
* good for returning multiple values from a function since Swift only allows you to return a single item

### Access Control

There are keywords you can use when defining, for example, your model API that states ("I will not change this API in a way that will break it"). This makes things like large development possible where you may have one whole team working on the model and another team just working on the ViewController.

* `internal`: this is the default, it means "usable by any object in my app or framework"
    * we don't normally type this
* `private`: "only callable from within this object"
* `private(set)`: "this property is readable outside of this object, but not settable"
* `fileprivate`: accessible by any code in this source file
* `public`: (for frameworks only) this can be used by objects outside my framework
* `open`: (for frameworks only) public and objects outside my framework can subclass this

### Extensions

Allows you to extend existing data structures


### enum

```swift
enumm FastFoodMenuItem {
	case hamburger(numberOfPatties: Int)
	case fries(size: FryOrderSize)
	case drink(String, ounces: Int)
	case cookie
}
```

enums, like structs get copied as they get passed around

Enums in swift are a little more powerful because each case can also have associated data.

Swift requires you to check every single state when using a switch statement to check the state of an item

Enums can have methods or vars but no storage

### Optionals

An Optional is just an `enum`. It essentially looks like:

```swift
enum Optional<T> {
	case none
	case some(<T>)
}
```
